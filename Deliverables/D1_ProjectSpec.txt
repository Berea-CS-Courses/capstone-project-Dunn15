1.  Overview
Enjoyment Encounters is a website with several interfaces designed for nursing home patients, hospital patients and any user.  This web site will contain at least four to six interfaces with links for entertainment to promote positive mental state of mind.  During the pandemic of 2020, most patients are alone in healthcare facilities with no interactions with anyone or anything.  The interfaces will allow patients to have activities on hand to choose that will promote interaction and maintain positivity while being in a healthcare facility.  This website will motivate wellness in body and mental state by making the patient an active way to pass the time while occupying their minds. 
 
2.  Features/Product Characteristics
	The major intended feature of Enjoyment Encounters will be making interfaces that will 	
	allow for the user to find games of interaction, arts such as: music/videos/painting and
	interactions with the outside world.  A product characteristic that a stake holder might
	anticipate is accessibility.  Accessibility to users with disabilities might require assistance 
	for interaction with Enjoyment Encounters.  The making of the interfaces along with the 	
	links may be time consuming so therefore the accessibility will not be included at this 
	time.
